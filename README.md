# Leaf-spectral-models-over-NEON-domains
Leaf spectral models used in the New Phytologist 2022 paper entitled "Leaf spectroscopy reveals divergent inter- and intra-species foliar trait covariation and trait-environment relationships across NEON domains" by Zhihui Wang, Philip A. Townsend, and Eric L. Kruger.

(1) Fresh leaf spectra models for broadleaf species: PLSR models to predict leaf chlorophylls, carotenoids and phenolics using the PSR measured fresh leaf spectra.

(2) Fresh leaf spectra models for conifer species: PLSR models to predict leaf chlorophylls, carotenoids and phenolics using the PSR measured fresh leaf spectra.

(3) Dry leaf spectra modesl: PLSR models to predict nine foliar traits such as carbon, nitrogen, etc. using the ASD FieldSpec3 measured dry leaf spectra.
